# Case Study: Birmingham Automotive Manufacturing Facility

## Project Overview

**Client:** Midlands Automotive Components Ltd  
**Location:** Birmingham, West Midlands  
**Project Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Service Area:** 15,000 sq ft manufacturing floor  
**Completion Date:** November 2025

## The Challenge

Midlands Automotive Components Ltd, a leading automotive parts manufacturer in Birmingham, faced significant operational challenges due to deteriorating floor conditions in their main production facility. Years of heavy machinery use, chemical exposure, and metal debris had left the concrete floor surface severely compromised with rust staining, coating failure, and uneven texture. The facility required a complete surface restoration that would minimize production downtime while delivering a durable, long-lasting finish capable of withstanding the demanding automotive manufacturing environment.

The project presented several critical requirements. First, the work needed to be completed during a planned three-week shutdown to avoid disrupting the facility's tight production schedule. Second, the surface preparation had to remove all existing coatings, rust, and contaminants down to bare concrete to ensure proper adhesion of new protective coatings. Third, the final surface needed to meet stringent automotive industry standards for cleanliness, durability, and chemical resistance.

## Our Solution

Our team deployed a comprehensive shot blasting solution specifically designed for large-scale industrial applications. We utilized steel shot blasting technology with S330 grade steel shot media, which provided the aggressive surface profile required for this demanding application. The process involved multiple passes across the entire 15,000 square foot area, systematically removing all existing coatings, rust deposits, and surface contaminants.

We implemented a phased approach to maximize efficiency while maintaining strict quality control. The facility was divided into three zones, each processed sequentially to allow for immediate coating application following blast cleaning. Our industrial-grade shot blasting equipment, capable of processing 2,000 square feet per day, ensured we stayed on schedule despite the project's scale.

Throughout the operation, we maintained rigorous dust control measures using integrated vacuum systems and containment barriers. This approach protected adjacent areas and equipment while ensuring a clean working environment. Our team worked extended shifts to complete the project within the client's three-week window, demonstrating our commitment to minimizing production impact.

## Technical Specifications

The shot blasting process achieved a surface profile of 75-100 microns (3-4 mils), ideal for the high-performance epoxy coating system specified by the client. We removed approximately 2-3mm of surface material, eliminating all previous coating layers and exposing sound concrete substrate. The steel shot media was continuously recycled through our equipment's separation system, ensuring consistent blast intensity and minimal waste.

Surface cleanliness was verified to meet ISO 8501-1 Sa 2.5 standard (near-white metal blast cleaning), with all visible oil, grease, and contaminants completely removed. We conducted regular surface profile measurements using replica tape to ensure consistency across the entire floor area. The prepared surface exhibited uniform texture and color, indicating thorough contamination removal and optimal conditions for coating application.

## Measurable Outcomes

The project delivered exceptional results that exceeded client expectations across multiple performance metrics. Surface preparation was completed in 18 days, three days ahead of the planned schedule, allowing the coating contractor additional time for application. This early completion saved the client an estimated £45,000 in lost production costs.

The shot-blasted surface provided superior coating adhesion, with pull-off adhesion tests averaging 3.2 MPa—significantly exceeding the 1.5 MPa minimum requirement. This enhanced adhesion translates to extended coating life and reduced maintenance costs over the facility's operational lifetime. The client reported a 40% improvement in floor durability compared to their previous surface preparation method, which had utilized mechanical grinding.

Post-project inspection revealed zero coating failures or delamination issues, a stark contrast to the previous floor coating that had experienced widespread failure within 18 months. The uniform surface profile achieved through shot blasting eliminated the uneven texture and trip hazards that had been present, improving workplace safety and reducing accident risk.

## Client Testimonial

"Commercial Shot Blasting transformed our manufacturing floor beyond our expectations. Their team's professionalism, efficiency, and attention to detail were outstanding throughout the project. Completing the work ahead of schedule saved us significant production costs, and the quality of the surface preparation has given us complete confidence in the longevity of our new floor coating. We've already recommended them to our sister facilities across the Midlands."

## Long-Term Impact

Six months following project completion, the facility floor continues to perform exceptionally well under demanding operational conditions. The client reports no coating degradation, delamination, or surface defects despite continuous exposure to heavy machinery, chemical spills, and metal debris. Regular inspections confirm the coating system remains fully bonded with no signs of premature wear.

The improved floor condition has delivered additional operational benefits beyond the primary restoration objectives. Facility cleaning time has been reduced by 30% due to the smooth, non-porous surface that resists dirt and contamination buildup. Employee feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with workers noting improved lighting reflection from the uniform surface and enhanced overall workplace appearance.

## Why This Project Succeeded

Several factors contributed to this project's exceptional outcome. Our extensive experience with large-scale industrial facilities enabled accurate project planning and resource allocation. The use of professional-grade shot blasting equipment, rather than less effective alternatives, ensured consistent results across the entire surface area. Our team's commitment to working within the client's operational constraints demonstrated flexibility and customer focus.

Thorough pre-project consultation allowed us to understand the client's specific requirements and develop a tailored solution. We provided detailed technical specifications and realistic timelines, building trust and setting clear expectations. Post-project support, including surface profile documentation and coating application recommendations, added value beyond the core blasting service.

## Technical Expertise Applied

This project showcased our comprehensive capabilities in industrial surface preparation. Our technicians' deep understanding of concrete substrate conditions, coating compatibility requirements, and automotive industry standards ensured optimal results. We applied advanced shot blasting techniques including multi-pass processing, controlled media flow rates, and precision surface profiling to achieve the demanding specifications.

Our investment in state-of-the-art equipment provided the power and efficiency required for this scale of operation. The integrated dust collection and media recycling systems demonstrated our commitment to environmental responsibility and workplace safety. Continuous quality monitoring throughout the project ensured consistent results and early identification of any potential issues.

## Conclusion

The Birmingham automotive facility project exemplifies our ability to deliver complex industrial surface preparation solutions that meet demanding technical requirements while respecting operational constraints. The combination of advanced shot blasting technology, experienced technicians, and customer-focused project management produced results that will benefit the client for years to come.
